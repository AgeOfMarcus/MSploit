# MSploit

This project is still under *heavy* development.
There may be, no, *are* bugs.

# Only to be used for educational purposes, don't blame me if something goes wrong


# To-do:
	* Add payload obfuscator
	* Add cooler payloads (and finish 'c2_via_http')
	* Make actual exploits not just reverse shells
